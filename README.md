# Pharmer Project

Pharmer is a project developed in the CBI for the AI Course provided by Atract Academy, ESADE, IED (European Design Institute), and UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya) during the spring term of 2024.

Our innovative project addresses the critical issue of agricultural wastewater treatment by focusing on phosphorus extraction and recycling. Through advanced detection techniques combined with the ATTRACT technologies, we capture phosphorus from wastewater and transform it into valuable fertilizer for local farmers. This circular approach not only mitigates water pollution but also fosters economic benefits, creating a sustainable agricultural ecosystem. By monitoring and analyzing data throughout the process, we enhance our ability to predict and manage phosphorus pollution effectively. This initiative not only champions environmental health but also bolsters the agricultural productivity of the region.
